                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <div class="words">
                        <p>Since the late 90s, I’ve been on a journey of personal growth. Of breakthroughs and sometimes
                            a question of survival. At times it has been rewarding. At others, it’s been a question of
                            life and death: physically, emotionally and spiritually.</p>

                        <p>The only things I have truly found that create the mind and body harmony and life shifts I
                            needed were hypnotherapy and certain types of coaching. I have spent years learning to
                            overcome deep rooted beliefs from my own childhood traumas which has ignited a passion in me
                            to help others.</p>

                        <p>To service this passion I have been personally trained in RTT by the UK’s top therapist,
                            Marissa Peer. I trained in therapy because I knew it had worked for me when, like you, I was
                            burnt out, depressed, exhausted and losing hope of ever feeling happy or healthy.</p>

                        <p> I am a change maker. I draw on my vast life experiences and learning about the mind across
                            several decades. My qualifications are in Clinical hypnotherapy, Advanced Rapid
                            Transformational Therapy and NLP coaching. Whatever mix of these modalities is right for
                            you, it will be: </p>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a>Transformational – as it gets to the root cause of your issue (rather than deal
                                        with the symptoms). Once this deepest, undesired, level is identified, it can be
                                        released. </a></li>
                                <li><a>Therapeutic – as it draws on proven modalities that can guide you, even if you
                                        are resistant to ‘trance’ or letting go or need a more supportive form of
                                        healing.</a></li>
                                <li><a>Trusted – it is not a temporary fix or sticking plaster that holds until another
                                        life-challenge tips the balance again. This is possible as it identifies,
                                        negotiates with, and eliminates, the old undesired beliefs. Subsequently,
                                        through a transformational process, new and desired beliefs can be installed in
                                        your neural pathways (the ‘hardwiring’ part of the brain). Thus leading to new
                                        feelings and behaviours installed at the deepest level. The subconscious
                                        level.</a></li>

                                    <p> "I was diagnosed with an illness 3 years ago. After a year I was struggling to
                                        manage it. Even with prescribed medication, it spiraled in to a chain reaction
                                        from hearing loss in 1 ear and imbalance to panic attacks, anxiety and onset
                                        depression. I could no longer drive, perform daily tasks, care for my family, be
                                        in the moment. I was trying all that I could. Different types of allopathic
                                        medication, homeopathy, physical therapy, meditation, exercises but nothing was
                                        helping. Then I met Subreen. She asked me to try RTT. She explained and I
                                        researched the process. We had 2 sessions to address the different areas. One
                                        for vertigo and hearing loss, the other for confidence. After the hypnotherapy
                                        sessions I felt myself release something (can call it energy, baggage, feelings
                                        and emotions that were no longer serving me). It felt great. Subreen provided me
                                        with audios to listen to. Since then I am more in controll of myself and my
                                        life. I'm back to being the person I know I am.
                                        I love that it didn't require me to go through weeks of talking therapy. Instead
                                        we went directly to the subconscious mind to find the cause and then address it.
                                        Thank you Subreen for your amazing work."</p>

                                    <p> "I was fortunate enough to come across Subreen, RTT Therapist, at a time in my
                                        life, when I didn't realise things were going so wrong for me and I couldn't
                                        understand what was the bigger problem Medically. Well for sure Subreem came to
                                        the rescue and within 90 minutes of seeing her she discovered that it was my
                                        Thyroid function that was the problem. She took me back in hypnosis, to three
                                        scenes, or parts of my life , to being a very young child and throughout my life
                                        .She allowed me to discover with the three scenes , the reason I was coming up
                                        with the problem I had today. It was truely amazing. She was patient, kind, very
                                        approachable and took the time to listen to what I had to say.
                                        As a result of having this session with Subreen my body was creating the high
                                        levels calcium that were concerning Doctors. My last visit with my blood results
                                        showed that the calcium had gone back to normal levels and they can't understand
                                        why. But I know why!! SOMEONE called Subreen!! Her Transformation for me was
                                        amazing and I would urge anyone thinking of a session for whatever reason your
                                        not feeling good about yourself , to pick up the phone, email by whatever means
                                        and contact her. She's truely remarkable and a beautiful person."</p>

Different types of allopathic medication, homeopathy, physical therapy, meditation, exercises but nothing was helping. Then I met Subreen. She asked me to try RTT. She explained and I researched the process. We had 2 sessions to address the different areas. One for vertigo and hearing loss, the other for confidence. After the hypnotherapy sessions I felt myself release something (can call it energy, baggage, feelings and emotions that were no longer serving me). It felt great. Subreen provided me with audios to listen to. Since then I am more in controll of myself and my life. I'm back to being the person I know I am. 
                                I love that it didn't require me to go through weeks of talking therapy. Instead we went directly to the subconscious mind to find the cause and then address it. Thank you Subreen for your amazing work.</div>

						<p>I was fortunate enough to come across Subreen, RTT Therapist , at a time in my life,  when I didn't realise things were going so wrong for me and I couldn't  understand what was the bigger problem Medically. Well for sure Subreem came to the rescue and within 90 minutes of seeing her she discovered that it was my Thyroid function that was the problem. She took me back in hypnosis, to three scenes, or parts of my life , to being a very young child and throughout my life .She  allowed me to discover with the three scenes , the reason I was coming up with the problem I had today. It was truely amazing. She was patient, kind, very approachable and took the time to listen to what I had to say.
						As a result of having this session with Subreen my body was creating  the high levels calcium  that were concerning Doctors. My last visit with my blood results showed that the calcium had gone back to normal levels and they can't understand why. But I know why!! SOMEONE called Subreen!! Her Transformation for me  was amazing and I would urge anyone thinking of a session for whatever reason your not feeling good about yourself , to pick up the phone, email by whatever means and contact her. She's truely remarkable and a beautiful person.
