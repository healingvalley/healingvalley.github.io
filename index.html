                                <div class="test">
                                    <p> "I was diagnosed with an illness 3 years ago. After a year I was struggling to
                                        manage it. Even with prescribed medication, it spiraled in to a chain reaction
                                        from hearing loss in 1 ear and imbalance to panic attacks, anxiety and onset
                                        depression. I could no longer drive, perform daily tasks, care for my family, be
                                        in the moment. I was trying all that I could. Different types of allopathic
                                        medication, homeopathy, physical therapy, meditation, exercises but nothing was
                                        helping. Then I met Subreen. She asked me to try RTT. She explained and I
                                        researched the process. We had 2 sessions to address the different areas. One
                                        for vertigo and hearing loss, the other for confidence. After the hypnotherapy
                                        sessions I felt myself release something (can call it energy, baggage, feelings
                                        and emotions that were no longer serving me). It felt great. Subreen provided me
                                        with audios to listen to. Since then I am more in controll of myself and my
                                        life. I'm back to being the person I know I am.
                                        I love that it didn't require me to go through weeks of talking therapy. Instead
                                        we went directly to the subconscious mind to find the cause and then address it.
                                        Thank you Subreen for your amazing work."</p>

                                    <p> "I was fortunate enough to come across Subreen, RTT Therapist, at a time in my
                                        life, when I didn't realise things were going so wrong for me and I couldn't
                                        understand what was the bigger problem Medically. Well for sure Subreem came to
                                        the rescue and within 90 minutes of seeing her she discovered that it was my
                                        Thyroid function that was the problem. She took me back in hypnosis, to three
                                        scenes, or parts of my life , to being a very young child and throughout my life
                                        .She allowed me to discover with the three scenes , the reason I was coming up
                                        with the problem I had today. It was truely amazing. She was patient, kind, very
                                        approachable and took the time to listen to what I had to say.
                                        As a result of having this session with Subreen my body was creating the high
                                        levels calcium that were concerning Doctors. My last visit with my blood results
                                        showed that the calcium had gone back to normal levels and they can't understand
                                        why. But I know why!! SOMEONE called Subreen!! Her Transformation for me was
                                        amazing and I would urge anyone thinking of a session for whatever reason your
                                        not feeling good about yourself , to pick up the phone, email by whatever means
                                        and contact her. She's truely remarkable and a beautiful person."</p>

                        <h4>What is RTT?</h4>
  	                    <p>Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT) is a powerful award-winning therapy that is fast and effective. Deploying RTT allows very quickly the discovery of the root cause of the Client’s  pains or issues. Despite using and invested in self-awareness and innumerable self-help books, programmes, or other therapies one is not ridden of the nagging thought of being a failure and emotive traps. RTT therapy is a scientific, psycho-therapeutic, somatic combination of demonstrated positive deployment of hypnotherapy components, NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming), CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Psychology) and psychotherapy with incredibly positive results empirically proven.</p>

                        <h4>How is it different?</h4>
  	                    <p>RTTⓇ helps the client uncover the root cause of why they feel the way they do. Unlike other therapies which focus on the issue or challenge, RTTⓇ helps the client discover the origin of the beliefs and behaviours  that have led to their issue. Using a unique set of tools and techniques, RTTⓇ supports the client in transforming their current issue and moving forward with a new set of more beneficial and positive beliefs.</p>

                        <h4>What can I expect from our session?</h4>
  	                    <p>Your Session with me will help you reach a deeply relaxed state to enable you to focus on past events. As the client, you will work alongside with me to uncover the meaning and interpretation you created at the time and the beliefs you formed as a result. You can then move on to reframe the way you look at the past from your adult perspective today.
                            Once that has been achieved, I will help you to create new, positive beliefs. This will be reinforced with a personalized audio for you to listen to for 21-30 days to establish beneficial change going forward. The process is completely safeguarded, with safety compassionate towards individual interest and therapist care, and highly scientific. The level of one’s self-committal to one’s transformation is significant and it allows the processes of engagement.</p>
